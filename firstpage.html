	<p> A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a <strong>central idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms</strong> of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument</p>
